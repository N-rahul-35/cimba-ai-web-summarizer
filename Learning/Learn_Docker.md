# Learn Docker

## 🚀 Introduction to Docker
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

- Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's Official Site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- Follow the installation steps and run the Docker Desktop app.

### 2. Install Docker on MacOS
- Download Docker Desktop for Mac from [Docker's Official Site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- Follow the installation steps.

### 3. Install Docker on Linux
- Run the following command for Ubuntu-based distros:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

## 🧑‍💻 Basic Docker Commands
- **Check Docker version:**
  ```bash
  docker --version
  ```

- **Run a Docker container:**
  ```bash
  docker run hello-world
  ```

- **List running containers:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- **Build a Docker image:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t my-image .
  ```

## 🛠️ Dockerizing Applications

### Example: Dockerize a Simple Node.js App

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

2. **Build and Run the Docker Image:**
```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-node-app
```

---

## 🔄 Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: my-node-app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
  db:
    image: mongo
```

To start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## 🎯 Advanced Topics

### Docker Networking
Docker allows you to create isolated networks for containers to communicate with each other.

```bash
docker network create my-network
docker run --network=my-network my-container
```

### Docker Volumes
Use Docker volumes to persist data generated by containers.
```bash
docker volume create my-volume
docker run -v my-volume:/data my-container
```

## ✅ Conclusion

Docker streamlines application deployment and enhances scalability by using containers. Mastering Docker will improve the portability and efficiency of your projects.
