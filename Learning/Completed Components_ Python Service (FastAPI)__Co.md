üöß In Progress
Scala Integration

[90%] Scala module connecting with PostgreSQL.
[90%] Communication with FastAPI and Spring Boot established.
Remaining: Complete integration layer and final testing.
Spring Boot

[90%] Main logic and controller setup.
Remaining: Complete service instantiation, resolve classpath dependencies (e.g., slick/lifted/Query error), finalize DI configuration.
üìù Notes
Encountered a runtime issue in Spring Boot due to missing slick class dependencies in the Scala wrapper.
Investigating JAR conflicts or adding the correct Scala dependency in the Spring Boot classpath.
